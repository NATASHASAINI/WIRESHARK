<b>Introduction</b><br>
In the realm of network analysis and security, Wireshark stands as a quintessential tool, offering a comprehensive suite of functionalities for capturing, analyzing, and understanding network traffic. This project delves into the fundamental capabilities of Wireshark, exploring its usage in various scenarios to gain insights into network communication. By engaging in these tasks, the end result will be to gain holistic understanding of Wireshark's functionalities and its pivotal role in network analysis and security. 

<b>Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Utilizing Wireshark's capturing capabilities, we'll intercept live network traffic flowing through your machine. By examining this captured data, we can dissect the intricacies of network protocols, inspect packet payloads, and identify potential security vulnerabilities or anomalies.</li>
</ul>

<b>RADIUS Traffic Analysis:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>With Wireshark, we'll focus on RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) traffic. Understanding RADIUS architecture, we'll capture and scrutinize RADIUS packets, deciphering encrypted passwords using shared secrets. This exercise enhances comprehension of authentication mechanisms within network infrastructures.</li>

<b>HTTP Protocol Exploration:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Delving into HTTP, we'll distinguish between Wireshark's Capture and Display Filters. By connecting to an HTTP server, initiating Basic and Form-based authentication, we'll capture and dissect HTTP traffic. This enables us to observe user credentials transmitted over the network, bolstering awareness of potential security risks.</li>

<b>Telnet and SSH Sessions:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Exploring Telnet and SSH (Secure Shell) protocols, we'll initiate sessions with remote devices. Capturing and analyzing traffic generated during these sessions using Wireshark enables us to assess security implications, contrasting the vulnerabilities of Telnet with the encrypted communication of SSH.</li>
